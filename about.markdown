I’m a Third Culture Kid, born and raised in southern Germany. I’ve been interested in computer programming since my teenage years. I studied computer science and earned my degree in 2001. Since then, I’ve been working as a professional software engineer and IT consultant.

Outside of work, I’m passionate about Karate and Japanese culture. I practice Goju-Ryu Karate and am proud to hold a 3rd Dan black belt. Alongside that, I’ve been studying Japanese for years and have achieved Level N2 in the [Japanese-Language Proficiency Test (JLPT)](https://www.jlpt.jp/e/about/levelsummary.html), which allows me to engage with Japanese media and traditions on a deeper level.

When I’m not coding or on the dojo mat, I enjoy discovering new technologies, learning about other cultures, and keeping my curiosity alive. 🌍✨
