# **Engineering Modern Data Solutions**
---

**I am a software architect and consultant**  
I have a strong focus on designing and implementing modern data architectures. My experience includes working with concepts like data mesh, advanced data analytics, and Azure Data & AI services to help optimize risks, costs, and performance. I enjoy simplifying complex technical architectures for diverse audiences, from technical teams to project managers, and delivering practical prototypes and solutions.

**Broad Experience Across Industries**  
With a background spanning various industries, I have gained hands-on experience in areas such as data warehousing, machine learning, generative AI, AI-assisted programming, and robotic process automation (RPA), along with programming languages like Python and SQL. Over the years, I have contributed to international projects across Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and the Americas, balancing strategy with hands-on implementation.

**Continuous Learning and Personal Projects**  
As a long-time member of the ACM and IEEE, I remain committed to continuous learning and expanding my technical knowledge. I enjoy coding and contributing to open-source projects, and I always look for opportunities to explore new programming technologies. Outside of work, I have been practicing karate since 1998 and continue to work on personal software projects whenever time allows.
