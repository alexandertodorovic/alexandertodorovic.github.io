## Exploring Data, AI, and Open Source Collaboration

Hello and welcome to my website!

I'm a professional software developer with extensive experience in software development, and I continuously seek new challenges to grow my skills further. When time allows, I enjoy working on my own projects, exploring new technologies, and sharing knowledge with the community.

I'm passionate about supporting open-source projects. While my full-time development role keeps me quite busy, I’m always happy to contribute with small tasks where I can make a positive impact.

---

My areas of expertise include Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, Python, and SQL. Currently, I’m expanding my knowledge in Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, and AI-assisted programming to stay at the forefront of modern software practices.

Thank you for visiting my site! Feel free to explore and reach out if you’d like to collaborate or just connect.
